## 🎯 The Best Next Recommended Step

### **Add CLI Integration Tests**

**Why:**
1. ✅ Completes core testing strategy (Unit ✅, E2E ✅, CLI ❌)
2. ✅ High impact for medium effort
3. ✅ Critical for automation users
4. ✅ Foundation for Phase 2/3 features

**How:**
Create `tests/cli.test.js` with 5+ tests:
- Basic RL-1 calculation
- Basic T4 calculation  
- JSON output format
- Help message
- Error handling

**Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Impact:** Complete test coverage of all public APIs

**See:** `COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed implementation guide
